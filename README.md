## Introduction
American Sign Language (ASL) serves as a vital communication medium for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. This project aims to leverage state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to develop an ASL Alphabet Recognition System that classifies static hand gestures (captured in images) into their corresponding letters in real time. By integrating robust convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transformer-based architectures, our model strives to achieve high accuracy and resilience under diverse real-world conditionsâ€”including variations in lighting, backgrounds, and hand orientations. This system is designed not only to streamline everyday communications but also to facilitate accessibility in educational, professional, and social settings, effectively bridging the communication gap between ASL users and non-signers.
